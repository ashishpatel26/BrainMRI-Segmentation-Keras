# MRI_Brain_Segmentation

This project is to study the use of Convolutional Neural Network and in particular the ResNet architecture. The show case is segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of human brain into anatomical regions[2]. We will extend the ResNet topology into the processing of 3-dimensional voxels.
